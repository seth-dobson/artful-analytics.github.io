A Blogdown-free approach for Chromebook users

## Introduction

Let's be honest. Can you really call yourself a member of the [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=hashtag_click) community if you don't have your own blog where you share cool stuff about [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)? Yes. But many R users and developers blog regularly about R, and many of them use the package [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to do it.

Blogdown is awesome. It helps you create really nice looking personal websites using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). And with RStudioâ€™s built-in blogdown package support, creating a new blog is as easy as `File -> New Project -> New Directory -> Website`, once blogdown and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) are installed locally.

Here's my problem. I prefer to use a [Chromebook](https://www.google.com/chromebook/) for my recreational data science activities, which means I work almost exclusively in [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). So for me, blogdown is not a viable option. Blogdown requires you to download Hugo and build your site locally, which defeats the purpose of a Chromebook in my opinion. I'd rather do everything in the cloud if possible.

Fortunately, RStudio Cloud has excellent integration with GitHub, and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) lets you create a blog directly from a  repository with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Like Hugo, Jekyll is a static website generator. The advantage of Jekyll for Chromebook and/or RStudio Cloud users is that setting up a blog is as easy as [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) (see below). With Jekyll, there is no need to download anything, or to build the site locally before deploying it GitHub Pages. You can, but it's not necessary.

In this post, I will describe how to quickly set up an R blog on GitHub Pages using Jekyll and RStudio Cloud.

## Getting started with Jekyll Now

Barry Clark has written an excellent tutorial entitled [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) that you should read. In this section, I will briefly summarize some of the main points of the tutorial. I will assume you already have a GitHub account. 

The first step in building your own site is to go to the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repository (or other Jekyll theme repo) and click `fork` in the upper right hand corner. Now you have an exact copy of the repo on your GitHub account.

Next, simply rename the forked repository as [yourusername].github.io and presto! GitHub Pages will build a site using the Jekyll Now theme, and host it for free at the aformentioned URL. It's just that simple.

At this point, you will want to customize your site's appearance by making changes to the `_config.yml` file in the main branch of the repo. This is where you can give your site a name and a brief description. You can also add an avatar, RSS feed, and social links that will appear at the bottom of your site. The Jekyll Now config file is well commented and easy to follow. 

Lastly, you should update the `about.md` file in the main branch if you want to have an "About Me" page on your blog that is well...about you.

After following these simple steps to set up your blog, you're ready to connect to RStudio Cloud and start writing #rstats posts.

## Writing Posts in RStudio Cloud

### Connect to repository

To connect your new GitHub repo to RStudio Cloud, all you have to do is follow a few [simple steps](https://bren.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015826731-How-to-connect-RStudio-Cloud-with-Github).

First, in your Workspace, click on "New Project" and select "New Project from GitHub Repo". Here you will be asked to enter the URL of your blog repository. Just copy and paste it, and click enter. RStudio Cloud will do the rest!

The next thing you'll want to do is configure Git in the RStudio Cloud terminal tab with the following lines of code:

`git config --global user.email "your email address"`
`git config --global user.name "your GitHub user name"`

Now you can add, commit, and push to your heart's content (If you have no idea what the heck I'm talking about, read this [Git/GitHub tutorial](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/) by [Karl Broman](https://twitter.com/kwbroman)).

### Create RMarkdown file

After you get your GitHub repo connected to RStudio Cloud, you're ready to start writing your posts.

Jekyll uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) files to create your website, but you will want to write your posts in RMarkdown. That means you have to create a new RMarkdwon document and add the following to the [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) front matter so you can [knit](https://yihui.org/knitr/) to Markdown.
