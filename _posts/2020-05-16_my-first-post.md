# About Me

My name is Seth Dobson, and this is my personal website, where I blog mostly about the statistical programming language R, but also about marketing and data science in general. 

I am currently an Analytics Manager at Merkle, a leading data-driven marketing company owned by the Dentsu Aegis Network. I work with clients to help transform data into actionable insights. All the views expressed here are my own.

# My Journey

My career path to marketing analytics has been unconventional to say the least.

I graduated from the University of Michigan with a BS in Anthropology-Zoology in 1999, and later earned a PhD in Biological Anthropology from Washington University in St. Louis in 2006. My dissertation research was on monkey facial expressions. 

In 2007, I landed a tenure track position at Dartmouth College, where I taught undergraduate courses and continued my research on primate behavior. You can see a list my publications on Google Scholar. 

After leaving academia in 2014,  and began searching for jobs as a data analyst. My first job outside of academia was at Discover Financial Services. I worked there for 4 years and learned a lot. Along the way, I taught myself R by blogging about football analytics as a hobby.
