My name is Seth Dobson, and this is my personal website, where I blog mostly about the statistical programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), but also about marketing and data science in general. All views expressed here are my own.

I am currently a Data Scientist at [Hill's Pet Nutrition](https://www.hillspet.com/), a subsidiary of [Colgate-Palmolive](https://www.colgatepalmolive.com/en-us). At Hill's, I am helping to build a data-driven approach to marketing using advanced analytics. Our focus is on increasing ditigal engagement and retention among veterinary clinics and pet parents.

My career path to marketing analytics has been unconventional to say the least.

I graduated from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) with a BS in Anthropology-Zoology in 1999, and later earned a PhD in [Biological Anthropology](https://physanth.org/career/career-biological-anthropology/) from [Washington University](https://wustl.edu/) in St. Louis in 2006. My dissertation research was on monkey facial expressions.

In 2007, I landed a tenure track position at Dartmouth College, where I taught undergraduate courses and continued my research on primate behavior (Fig. 1). You can see a list of my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ndsicGMAAAAJ&hl=en). 

After leaving academia in 2014,  I began searching for jobs as a data analyst. My first job outside of academia was at [Discover Financial Services](https://www.discover.com/). I worked there for 4 years and learned a lot about business intelligence and predictive analytics. Along the way, I taught myself R by blogging about Scottish [football analytics](http://fitbafancystats.blogspot.com/) as a hobby.

I joined [Merkle](https://www.merkleinc.com/), a performance marketing agency owned by the [Dentsu Aegis Network](https://www.dentsuaegisnetwork.com/), in November, 2018. From there, my career in marketing analytics really took off :rocket:

My job involves using R everyday, which I love. I work remotely from my home in Peoria, AZ, much to the delight of my cats (Fig. 2).
