My name is Seth Dobson, and this is my personal website, where I blog mostly about the statistical programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), but also about marketing and data science in general. 

I am currently an Analytics Manager at [Merkle](https://www.merkleinc.com/), a leading data-driven marketing agency owned by the [Dentsu Aegis Network](https://www.dentsuaegisnetwork.com/). I work with clients to help transform data into actionable insights. All the views expressed here are my own.

### My Journey

My career path to marketing analytics has been unconventional to say the least.

I graduated from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) with a BS in Anthropology-Zoology in 1999, and later earned a PhD in [Biological Anthropology](https://physanth.org/career/career-biological-anthropology/) from [Washington University](https://wustl.edu/) in St. Louis in 2006. My dissertation research was on monkey facial expressions.

In 2007, I landed a tenure track position at Dartmouth College, where I taught undergraduate courses and continued my research on primate behavior (Fig. 1). You can see a list of my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ndsicGMAAAAJ&hl=en). 

After leaving academia in 2014,  I began searching for jobs as a data analyst. My first job outside of academia was at [Discover Financial Services](https://www.discover.com/). I worked there for 4 years and learned a lot about business intelligence and predictive analytics. Along the way, I taught myself R by blogging about Scottish [football analytics](http://fitbafancystats.blogspot.com/) as a hobby.
